          <h2>Welcome to Rainforests in Sri-Lanka</h2>
          <p>The  most famous rainforests in Sri Lanka are Peak Wilderness , 250 km2 ; Knuckles , 175 km2 ; Kanneliya Rain forest (Kanneliya – Dediyagala – Nakiyadeniya )and the Sinharaja World Heritage Site , 90 km2 . The elusive loris , the majestic elephant and fierce eyed leopards are found within these rainforests.</p>
			 <Br>
          <p>Natural forests cover about 20 % of the tropical island of Sri Lanka . However , distribution in the major hygroclimatic zones is biased towards the drier parts of the island . Forest coverage is about 30 % in the dry zone , but only 9 % in the wet zone where Sri Lanka's rain forests occur.</p>
		     <br>
		  <p>Located in south - west Sri Lanka , Sinharaja is the country's last viable area of primary tropical rainforest . More than 60 % of the trees are endemic and many of them are considered rare.</p>

		<p>Birdlife in Sinharaja Rain Forest</p>
		<p>Sinharaja Rain Forest is home to numerous indigenous birds such asthe Ceylon Hanging Parrot (Loriculus beryllinus), the Ceylon Grey Hornbill (Ocyceros gingalensis), the Ashy-headed Laughing Thrush (Garrulax cinereifrons), Layard’s parakeet (Psittacula calthripae), the Jungle fowl (Gallus lafayetii ), the Spur fowl (Galloperdix bicalcarata), the Ceylon Wood Pigeon (Columba torringtonii), the Brown- capped Babbler (Pellorneum fuscocapillum), the Red-faced Malkoha (Phaenicophaeus pyrrhocephalus) and the Ceylon Blue Magpie (Urocissa ornate) among others, are prominent in this area.</p>
		<p>19 of Sri Lanka’s 20 species of endemic bird species in Sri Lanka are found in the Sinharaja Reserve Among the endangered birds are Sri Lanka Wood Pigeon, Green-Billed Coucal, Sri Lankan white-headed starling, Red-faced Malkoha, Green-billed Caucal, Sri Lanka Spur fowl Sri Lankan Blue Magpie, and Ashy-headed Babbler, all of which are endemic.</p>
		<p>Mammals, Reptiles, Amphibians and Butterflies</p>
		<p>Out of 12 endemic mammal species of the country 8 are found here. Giant squirrel, dusky-stripped jungle squirrel, badger mongoose and endemic purple-faced leaf monkey and torque macaque are frequently seen.</p>
		<p>Many threatened species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and butterflies are found in the Reserve including the leopard. Endemism among mammals and butterflies is greater than 50%. Reptiles and amphibia include python, endemic green pit viper, endemic hump nosed lizard (Lyriocephalus scutatus) and rough-nose horned lizard (Ceratophora aspera).</p>
		<p>Conservation Value Sinharaja</p>
		<p>Conservation Value Sinharaja is the last extensive primary lowland tropical rain forest in Sri Lanka. It holds a large number of endemic species of plants and animals, and a variety of plants of known benefit to man. Sinharaja Forest Reserve is the last viable remnant of Sri Lanka’s tropical lowland rain forest; over 60% of the trees are endemic and many of these are rare; and there are 21 endemic bird species, and a number of rare insects, reptiles and amphibians (IUCN Technical Evaluation).</p>
		<p>The long-term success of conserving Sinharaja depends upon the sustainable development of its buffer and peripheral zones through a participatory approach emphasizing the involvement of local people. Construction of hotels on peripheral zones and constructions of roads over the protected areas are bound to result in irrecoverable damages to this world heritage site.</p>

Sinharaja is bounded by rivers on three sides. On the north, Sinharaja is bounded by the Napola Dola and Koskulana Ganga. On the south and south-west are the rivers Maha Dola and Gin Ganga. On the west are the river Kalukandawa Ela and river Kudawa Ganga. To the east of Sinharaja is an ancient footpath near Beverley Tea Estate and by the Denuwa Kanda.</p>
		<p>Reaching Sinharaja Rain Forest</p>
		<p>From Northern or western parts of the country you can reach Sinharaja Forest Reserve via Ratnapura, Kiriella, Kalawana, Weddala. From the South you can enter Sinharaja Rain Forest from Deniyaya. Coming form Hambantota, Udawalawe you can enter Sinharaja from Rakwana side.</p>
		<p>Area of Sinharaja Rain Forest</p>
		<p>The total area of the Sinharaja Forest Reserve is 18,900 acres or 7,648 hectares. It ranges in altitude from 300m to 1,170m.</p>

		<p>Establishment of Sinharaja Forest Reserve</p>
		<p>Most of the area of Sinharaha forest was originally declared a forest reserve under the Waste Lands Ordinance in 1875. In 1978, Sinharaja Rain Forest was included in the international network of biosphere reserves, established and maintained as part of UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) program. In October 1988, this reserve, together with a northeastern extension of it, was declared Sri Lanka’s first National Wilderness Heritage Area. In December 1988, the Sinharaja Biosphere Reserve became Sri Lanka’s first natural site to be added to the UNESCO World Heritage list.</p>
		<p>Climate on Sinharaja Rain Forest</p>

          <h2>&nbsp &nbsp Peak Wilderness sanctuary Rainforest</h2>
		      
          <p>"Sri Pada" Peak Wilderness sanctuary is a tropical rain forest that spreads over a land of 224 square kilometers around the Sri Pada 
		(Adam's Peak) mountain. A huge forest area that belonged to the Peak Wilderness was cut down and cleared during the British colonial rule in Sri Lanka 
		(1815-1948) to gain land for the massive tea estates which are still functioning in Nuwara Eliya district. The remaining portion of the Peak Wilderness
		was declared a wildlife sanctuary on October 25, 1940.

		This tropical rain forest, spread over 224 square kilometers around the famed Adam's Peak mountain, contains varied and unusual geographical formations 
		compared to the other natural reserves of the island. Access is via Hatton Kuruwita and Palabaddala route, the latter being favoured by Buddhist 
		devotees and other tourists on pilgrimage to Adam’s Peak.</p>

          <h2>&nbsp &nbsp Makandawa Rainforest</h2>
		      
          <p>The Makandawa Forest Reserve is one of Sri Lanka’s richest and most unspoiled rainforests. It covers an area of 1155 hectares and lies close to the village of Kithulgala, one of Sri Lanka’s centers for adventure sports. The reserve hosts a plethora of rare and endemic flora and fauna. It also hides one of Sri Lanka’s well known ancient treasures; the Belilena Cave.  Makandawa is also the selfsame rainforest where the famous World War II movie, ‘The Bridge over the River Kwai’.
		  <p>The Forest</p>
	<p>This secondary lowland rainforest has several interesting geographical features; such as crystal clear natural rock pools, waterfalls, wonderfully challenging trails that meander through the thick tropical rainforest, and of course the Kelani River running right through the jungle. As such it is a great place to go hiking, whitewater rafting, birdwatching or butterfly watching. There are also a number of adventure sports that you can engage in in Kithulgala.</p>
	<p>For those interested in the flora and fauna; there are a number of rare species to be observed here. These include fish such as the Asoka Barb, Black Ruby Barb, Black-lined Barb and the Stone Sucker; as well as 54 rare bird species such as the endemic Sri Lankan Orange-billed Babbler, Green billed Coucal, the Chestnut-backed Owlet, Yellow-fronted Barbet, Ceylon jungle & spur fowl, Layard’s Parakeet, Ceylon Lorikeet, Common Hill Mynah, the Black-rumped Flameback, Sri Lankan Crested Drongo, Ceylon Grey Hornbill, and the Sri Lankan Brown-capped Babbler; and several species of endemic butterflies, dragonflies and reptiles. The most commonly seen mammal is the Grizzled-tailed giant squirrel, while the Red Slender Loris is more rarely seen.</p>
	<p>The Makandawa forest receives rainfall mainly during the two monsoon seasons. During these seasons the Kelani River runs wild and wide making it impossible to cross without a boat; and a traditional dugout canoe with an outrigger is commonly used by the locals for this task.</p>
	<p>Belilena Caves</p> 
	<p>The Belilena Caves were the habitation of the Balangoda Man; an ancient species of men who were discovered to have lived many thousands of years before the calculated beginnings of mankind. They lived for a period between 32000 and 9000 years ago and used advanced techniques and tools to hunt and survive. The skeletal remains found here in excavations, were dated to be from 16000 years ago and are some of the oldest in the world.</p>
	<p>The Filming</p> <p>The Bridge over the River Kwai was an award-winning 1957 British-American war film. Shot in the jungles of Makandawa, this complex and touching story depicts British prisoners in a Japanese military prison camp in Burma during the Second World War. The imprisoned soldiers are ordered to build a bridge across the river Kwai for military purposes. Though based on a bridge in Thailand, the actual shooting of the film took place at a bridge in the Kithulgala region jungles, where a wooden bridge was built across the Kelani River especially for the shooting. It was later dismantled to protect the ecology. However, there still exists an innocuous looking old wooden sign on a lonely narrow trail in Makandawa, directing visitors to the location of the filming.</p>

        <h6><p> Why are rainforests important?</p>
		<p>The rainforest is not just a pretty face!</p>
		<p>As well as the vivid beauty that comes with great diversity in plants and animals, rainforests also play a practical role in keeping our planet healthy.</p>
		<p>By absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing the oxygen that we depend on for our survival. The absorption of this CO2 also helps to stabilize the Earth's climate.</p>
		<p>Rainforests also help to maintain the world's water cycle by adding water to the atmosphere through the process of transpiration which creates clouds. Water generated in rainforests travel around the world.</p>
		
	   <p>Save rainforest -
       You want to save the rainforest and are looking for effective everyday tips? Then you just have a great attitude! Because the Deforestation for human purposes is one of the greatest challenges of our time. It is bizarre that we have to save the rainforest at all. From whom, actually? From ourselves, in fact. The only positive thing about it is that we obviously have the solution to the problem in our own hands.</p>
